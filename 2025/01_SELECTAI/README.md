## Part: SELECT AI for spatial queries

My tests with `SELECT AI` to generate SQL queries use a few spatial datasets. You need to load the data first.

The data for the tables

* US_COUNTIES
* US_STATES

are stored in [this folder](./data). Use [Oracle Spatial Studio](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/spatial-studio/get-started.html) to load them into your 23ai Autonomous Database. IF you havenÂ´t yet installed Spatial Studio, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/spatial-studio/oracle-spatial-studio-downloads.html).

Use the following scripts to create the remaining tables and fill them with data:

* [US_AIRPORTS](./scripts/sql/us_airports.sql)
* [US_CITIES](./scripts/sql/us_cities.sql)
* [US_HOSPITALS](./scripts/sql/us_hospitals.sql)
* [USGS_EARTHQUAKES](./scripts/sql/usgs_earthquakes.sql)
